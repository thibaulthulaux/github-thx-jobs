<p>Dear Recruiting Team,</p>
<p>Good day !</p>
<p>One of your employee pointed me to your ad for a job opening as a Technical Support Specialist. This letter is to indicate my strong interest in applying for the position.</p>
<p>I have been working as a support specialist at Dalim for the past 4 years. My previous work experience has equipped me for this job, and I believe that this, as well as my background, my work ethics and my enthusiasm, make me a good addition to your team.</p>
<p>I have grown a solid experience as a support engineer in a software company, as part of an international 24/7 support team with agile methods. I have acquired a good understanding of the cloud computing environment and a strong skillset in its usage. I am familiar with a lot of operating systems and server technologies, and I know how to troubleshoot business-critical installations remotely.</p>
<p>I’m used to maintain a good relation with extremely demanding clients, such as agencies, brands, editors, publishers, printers or even institutional customers (Ikea, Burda, QuadGraphics, Council of Europe, Unesco…).</p>
<p>Attached is a more detailed outline of my prior experiences as shown in my resume. References are also available upon request. Please feel free to call me or to contact me on skype, so that we could arrange for an interview.</p>
<p>Thank you for this opportunity, I hope to speak with you soon.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
