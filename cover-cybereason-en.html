<p>Dear Recruiting Team,</p>
<p>Good day !</p>
<p>I’m delighted to discover a job opening as a Senior Technical Support Engineer in your company. This letter is to indicate my strong interest in applying for the position.</p>
<p>I have been working as a support specialist at Dalim for the past 4 years. My previous work experience has equipped me for this job, and I believe that this, as well as my technical background, my work ethics, my natural curiosity and my enthusiasm, make me a good addition to your team.</p>
<p>I have grown a solid experience as a support engineer in a software company, as part of an international 24/7 support team with agile methods. I am familiar with a lot of operating systems and server technologies, and I know how to troubleshoot business-critical installations.</p>
<p>I’m also used to maintain a good relation with extremely demanding clients, such as agencies, brands, editors, publishers, printers or even institutional customers (Ikea, Burda, QuadGraphics, Council of Europe, Unesco…), and I have always been seen as extremely professionnal and reliable.</p>
<p>Attached is a more detailed outline of my prior experiences as shown in my resume. References are also available upon request. Please feel free to call me or to contact me by mail, so that we could arrange for an interview.</p>
<p>Thank you for this opportunity, and I hope to speak with you soon.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
